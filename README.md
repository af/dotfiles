# dotfiles

Rebuilding my dotfiles from scratch and putting them online for future reference.


## Setup
* clone the repo
* (OS X) Install homebrew
* (OS X) Install homebrew dependencies with `./brew_installs.sh`
* run `install.py`


## Misc Mac-only binaries to install:
* Hydra (or whatever I eventually replace it with)
* Quicksilver
